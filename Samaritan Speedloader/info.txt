I reccomend printing with ABS-like resin.

You will need a 4-40 tap to thread the screw holes.

One brass or stainless 4-40 x 1/2" flathead screw is needed to secure the shaft.

Four brass or stainless 4-40 x 9/16" flathead screws are needed to secure the cap.

Four springs are needed. I used 0.3x3mm OD - 10mm Length springs.
